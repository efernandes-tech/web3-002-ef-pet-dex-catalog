Based on all our interactions so far, create a Markdown file named `DCP.md`.

The first line must be exactly:
Development Continuation Prompt

Then include the following sections:

## Project Name

[Name]

## Summary

[Brief 1â€“2 sentence project description]

## Current State

[What has been done so far, main files, architecture, tech stack, dependencies]

## Next Steps

[Clear numbered list of pending tasks]

## Known Issues

[Blockers, bugs, limitations]

## Notes

[Design decisions, constraints, references, style guides, URLs]

The file must be fully self-contained so another AI agent can continue without any prior context.
